			<p>I used to like drawing since I was a child. I enjoyed manga and anime as well. In high school, I got to discover Hayao Miyazaki or Hideaki Anno’s works, this is where I understood how animation was dependent of the director. From that point, it made me aspire to become a creator and work in animation someday.
			<br><br>
			I went to art school, where I was specializing in fine arts. When I graduated, I thought again about my future.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>"I figured I wanted to make animation. I decided to take the leap and to start training for it."</h3> 

			<p>I had entered graduate school, but I dropped out and joined the industry from there.</p>

			<p> For the birth of PUPARIA, I had been always impressed by animators, which motivated me to start in the industry. However, after 5 years working in animation, I started to feel as if I were losing myself.<br> No matter how hard your work, animation is something that is consumable. That’s what it is by nature of course.
			<br><br>
			However, it became harder and harder for me to cope with. I thought that pursuing that path would make me start hating my drawings.<br>I would start to hate even the simple act of drawing. I had reached my limit at the time. I thought I had to start from scratch. So in 2015,<br>I decided to fully stop drawing to make some time where I wouldn’t do anything. This is when I quit.
			<br><br>
			For about one year and a half, I didn’t do anything, without drawing at all. I just spent time reading and walking outside. During that time, ideas started to flow, I gradually wanted to make a work of my own. Nobody had asked for it, but I thought I’d give it a try and start.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>"It was as if I wanted to leave a trace of my mindset of that time wandering around,<br>not doing anything. I thought of carving that mindset through the animation medium and dedicate myself to it. This led to PUPARIA."</h3>

			<p>PUPARIA comes from English’s “puparium”. It depicts the chrysalis or the pupa, meaning the shell of the larvae. Simply put, I had a strong feeling that the values shaping our world were gradually fading away.
			<br><br>
			I felt that the things we used to rely on and relate to were starting to collapse. I believe many people had that feeling worldwide,<br>even before coronavirus hit. The fact that we couldn’t be ourselves anymore somehow. At the same time we couldn’t see what the future was holding for us. I really had that feeling these past years.
			<br><br>
			From there, I didn’t want to make something patronizing. I wanted to make a story and a world that would wrap people from another angle.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>"I aimed at expressing a feeling of being supported, I wanted to make something<br>like that."</h3>

			<p>For the graphic approach, I wanted for both the characters and backgrounds to be clear, without deception.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h3>"I knew I was aiming to make something very abstract and difficult to understand."</h3>  
			
			<p>So I thought it wasn’t a good thing to use difficult or blurry methods<br>
				of expression.
			<br>
			<br>
			For a theme like this, I made sure for the surface to be as clearly drawn as possible. The characters are close to manga in my opinion. I like the symbolism you find in manga. Its symbols are so strong that sometimes manga can be considered to be “cheap”. I believe that is because what it expresses is so loud and clear, that sometimes the readers think it’s too much and consider it to be cheap.
			<br>
			<br>
			On the contrary, I wanted to insist on the drawings to make sure my emotions were expressed through the characters. I wanted these emotions to show.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h3>"I wanted to the characters’ expressions to feel alive to the viewer. It shouldn’t feel hand-drawn, but instead I wanted to feel life in their movements."</h3>

			<p>I believe that animation is also about the pictures. I enjoy animation when you see beauty in the pictures, so I wanted to set that in my own way.
			<br>
			<br>
			The fact that it had to be made independently. Seeing PUPARIA,<br>I knew that nobody would want to make something like this. I didn’t want to annoy people by involving them into it. It was simply made from personal motivations. I really wanted to engrave my own emotions into that world.</p>

			<p>
			There was no other solution than making it by myself. It didn’t matter if it would go ignored, as for me it was a necessary step in order to be able to go forward. So it really had to be an independent work.</p>

			<p>Being all by myself was really hard. The workload was gigantic. There were days when I would clean drawings or just scan all day long. It was surreal to do this all alone. Having to do everything by myself and looking at all the time I was spending, I was really at my limit.</p>

			<p>Looking at the pros of working alone on the other hand,<br>I enjoy understanding what a creator likes and what he’s aiming for in his work. It can be in the picture, the sounds or the music, it’s all engraved there. I really like that, regardless of the type of story,<br>I get a feeling of respect when I can picture what the creator wanted to express.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>"Just bringing a project to the end is something respectable by itself."</h3>
			
			<p>I feel it’s harder and harder to achieve these days. Being able to express what you like without any shame, it’s something that needs courage. However I believe it’s a fundamental source of joy for humans. I wanted to see that, the anime works I used to see as a child were really showing these personal emotions. This is what had moved me, so this is the type of work I wanted to pursue.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>"I really wanted to avoid lying and stay as honest as possible in what I wanted to achieve with my work, as I believe that’s what makes it beautiful."</h3>
